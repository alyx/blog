BLOG
====

Blog is my high-performance blogging software, designed to give a secure
and performant system with which to blog (As opposed to the current market of
mostly, in my opinion, trash). 

The goal of this system is to present a powerful base platform, as well as
a modular system with which to power the holding of comments and blog posts.


Although at a later time, we may switch to an in-house fcgi library, at the
present, it seems like the official fcgi library is more than good enough.
